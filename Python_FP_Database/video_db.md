List of tasks to manage Film datsbase:

This databaase is meant for an industry that doesn't exist anymore so 
not the most economically minded product ever devised.

The theme of all my projects in this course have been film related; from the
film related graphs built in R to the SQL databases produced to run an old school 
video store (in which I worked a thousand years ago)

Continuing both the theme and a very concrete link, I've taken the databases from
my SQL project and joined them to the app and api in this project.

1. Search database
    - for all films
    - for a single film
2. Add film
3. Remove film
4. Update film
5. Exit program

Tasks for Customer database:

1. Create password for customer
2. Add name (first and last)
3. Add email address
4. Add phone number (optional)
5. Generate password for them (optional if we have time)
